== Introduction ==
All ermeX functionallity is in the namespace ermeX.


== What is an ermeX Network?==
An ermeX Nerwork is a set of components interconnected using ermeX
---

== How to configure and Start ermeX ==
The configuration can be done programatically. You place the configuration code at your component startup so its introduced to the ermeX Network.

Two steps:
  * Prepare the configuration:
     {{{
     ...
     Configuration cfg = Configuration.Configure(ComponentId).ListeningToTcpPort(6666)
                  .RequestJoinTo(remoteIP,remotePort,remoteComponentId);
     ...
     }}}

  * Start the component using the configuration:
    {{{
    ...
       WorldGate.ConfigureAndStart(cfg); 
    ...
    }}}

==== Mandatory configuration ====
  * Each component using has an unique id in an ermeX network, this is configured as below:
   {{{
   ...
    Configuration cfg = Configuration.Configure(ComponentId);
   ...
   }}}
*ComponentId* should be always the same for a given component

  * Specifying the port where the component listens:
   {{{
   ...
   cfg = cfg.ListeningToTcpPort(myPort);
   ...
   }}}


==== Friend component ====
To join in an ermeX network all your component need to know is another component in the network. As the first component created dont need to join to any component this invocation is not mandatory:
   {{{
   cfg = cfg.RequestJoinTo(remoteIP,remotePort,remoteComponentId)
   }}}

==== Databases ====
ermeX can use the following databases
  * SQL Server: method _SetSqlServerDb(...)_ uses a previously created db (it can be empty) and you pass the connection string to it
  * SQLite: method _SetSqliteDb(...)_ uses an SQLite db
  * In-Memory: method _SetInMemoryDb(...)_ to use only if message delivery between sessions is not mandatory, as the db is removed when the component is disposed

== How to stop the component ==
ermeX dont need to be stopped after is started as it will be implictly done when is disposed, when the host application finishes.

You can stop the component to be reconfigured and restarted by:

   {{{
   WorldGate.Reset();
   }}}

== How to subscribe to a message ==
First you need a subscriptor. This is any type that implements the interface ermeX.IHandleMessages<<TheMessageTypeIWantToBeNotified>>.

The handler will be invoked everytime a message of the type you specified in the generic parameter is published to the ermeX network


The subscription to messages can be done in two different ways
  * By configuration:
    Its done when setting up the configuration, you provide the assemblies where the subscriptors are, and specify the types you don't want to subscribe.
    {{{
    ...
    cfg = cfg.DiscoverSubscriptors(assemblies,typesToExclude);
    ...
    }}}
  * Dinamically: 
    Its done once the component was started
    {{{
    ...
    WorldGate.Suscribe<MyHandler>();
    ...
    }}}
