== Introduction ==
All ermeX functionallity is in the namespace ermeX.


== What is an ermeX Network?==
An ermeX Nerwork is a set of components interconnected using ermeX
---

== How to configure and Start ermeX ==
The configuration can be done programatically. You place the configuration code at your component startup so its introduced to the ermeX Network.

Two steps:
  * Prepare the configuration:
     {{{
   Configuration cfg = Configuration.Configure(ComponentId).ListeningToTcpPort(6666)
                  .RequestJoinTo(remoteIP,remotePort,remoteComponentId);
     }}}

  * Start the component using the configuration:
    {{{
       WorldGate.ConfigureAndStart(cfg); 
    }}}

==== Databases ====
ermeX can use the following databases
  * SQL Server: method _SetSqlServerDb(...)_ uses a previously created db (it can be empty) and you pass the connection string to it
  * SQLite: method _SetSqliteDb(...)_ uses an SQLite db
  * In-Memory: method _SetInMemoryDb(...)_ to use only if message delivery between sessions is not mandatory, as the db is removed when the component is disposed

== How to stop the component ==
ermeX dont need to be stopped after is started as it will be implictly done when is disposed, when the host application finishes.

You can stop the component to be reconfigured and restarted by:

   {{{
   WorldGate.Reset();
   }}}
